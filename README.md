# Task4-ESP32-Servo-Motor

In this task I have equipped the ESP32 with a 180 degree rotation servo motor, the function of this project is to allow the ESP32 to control the angle of the servo motor through 6 buttons connected to 6 pins on the ESP32 and each has a specific degree that it rotates around it:
PIN#1 ==> 30  degree
PIN#2 ==> 60  degree
PIN#3 ==> 90  degree
PIN#4 ==> 120 degree
PIN#5 ==> 150 degree
PIN#6 ==> 180 degree
